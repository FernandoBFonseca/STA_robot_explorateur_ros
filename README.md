# STA_robot_explorateur_ros ðŸ¤–

This is a project developed for the subject SystÃ¨mes de transport autonome (Autonomous transport systems) at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille, where the goal of the project is to make an explorer robot, equipped with a lidar, able to recognize the environment around it, map it and move around in it.

The project was developed using ROS and although the Noetic ROS code is found in this directory, it is highly recommended that instead of cloning it directly, you access the project's main git: https://github.com/FernandoBFonseca/STA_robot_explorateur , as it is there that you will find the setup.sh file. Cloning this directory to the correct folder catkin_ws/src will also send it to your RaspberryPi and compile it.

Also, in the main git you will find a folder with the developed code for the Arduino connected to the motors and encoders and the project subject.

Have a nice day
